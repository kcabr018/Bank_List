# Bank_List
This is a GUI in which the user can add or delete bank names from a list.

The "Add Bank's Name" tab is used for making a list of all possible banks that the user would like to choose from.
In the "Select Bank" tab, the user can choose from the list created in the "Add Bank's Name" tab, by selecting the bank from the list on the left, and pressing the "Add" button. The added bank will appear in the list on the ride portion of the window. The user can remove a Selected Bank by clicking the bank name on the right portion of the window and pressing the remove button.
